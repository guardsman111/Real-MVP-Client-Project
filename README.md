Team Members:
Alex Davis - Project Lead (PL)
Charlie Parsons - Technical Lead (TL)
Harry Palmer - Client Liaison (CL)

Roles:
Project Lead - The Project Lead is responsible with managing the project as a whole (such as using project management tools, writing up design documents for the projects, making the documentation for the project, etc). The PL is also responsible with writing up the questions to ask to the client (with help with the other team members). 
Technical Lead - The Technical Lead is responsible with managing the git repo, reviewing all of the code, managing the code base, helping out the project lead with creating the technical design document and relaying any technical queries/problems to the client/client liaison.
Client Liaison -  The Client Liaison is responsible with conversing with the client, breaking down what the client wants so that we can effectively make the project for the client, relaying progress back to the client and fixing any issues that rise between the team and the client.

Communication:
As a team, our main communication method will using Facebook messenger. If they are unavailable or something is urgent, then a secondary method (phone numbers) would be used. Between the client liaison and the client, the main communication method would be decided between the two of them.

Meetings:
Everyone shall conduct a group meeting every week on Monday (preferably from 2pm to 5pm). If there’s any reason to organize another group meeting during that week, everyone should say what their schedule is so that they can organize a time where everyone is free.

Lateness/Unavailability:
If one person is not available on the monday then one of the other remaining team members will assume the role of the missing team member. If 2 or more team members are unavailable for the day then the meeting will be cancelled and a new meeting will be made during the week at a different time. If someone is late then they must say in the team chat why they’re late (must be valid reasons).

Ownership of the assets:
All of the assets within the client’s specification will be owned by the client, if we create anything else outside of the specification then we’ll discuss ownership of the assets.

Outsourcing assets:
In the event that we need to outsource any creation of assets, we must decide who we would outsource it to or organize interviews with potential asset creators. For any asset they create, we’ll credit them in the credits. If we need to use any free 3rd party assets, we’ll also credit them in the credits (include a link to the site where we got them).

Version Control:
The technical lead is responsible for watching over the repo and with each task, there will be a branch for it. Once the task is finished, the user of the branch will do a pull request and the technical lead would review the request and if it’s of satisfactory quality, it would be merged in the master. There will also be a repo for the main project and a repo for all of the art assets made for the project. 

Team Member Firing/Leaving:
In the event of a team member leaving or dragging the project down as a whole, we’ll hold a team meeting (with Dan or Paul in attendance) to see whether or not the team member can continue. If the team member can’t continue, then we’ll help them out with whatever we can. 

Hiring new Team Members:
In the event of a team member has left the team, the remaining 2 team members will hold interviews with potential candidates to see whether or not they would be a great fit with the team. If they are successful, the original team members will help them out with catching up with what they need to do for the project and have them look at and sign the agreement document.

This document was agreed upon by each member of the team.
